# Lab 1: Network Scanning and Enumeration

### Steps:

**1.  Use nmap to perform a basic scan on the target network.**
```
nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
```
**2. Perform service version detection.**
```
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
```

# Lab 2: Web Application Scanning

### Steps:

**1. Use a web application scanner like OWASP ZAP or Nikto to scan the target web application.** 
```
zap-full-scan.py -t http://target-app.com
```
**2. Analyze the results to identify common vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection).**


# Lab 3: Vulnerability Assessment with OpenVAS

### Steps:

**1. Set up OpenVAS and configure the target.**
```
sudo openvas-setup
```

**2. Run a vulnerability scan.**
```
sudo openvas-start
```

# Lab 4: Password Cracking

### Steps:

**Use a password cracking tool like John the Ripper or Hashcat.**
```
john --format=NT hashfile.txt
```

# Lab 5: Social Engineering Assessment

- Conduct simulated phishing campaigns using tools like GoPhish.
- Analyze user responses and awareness.
```
gophish
```

# Lab 6: Wireless Network Assessment

**1. Use tools like Aircrack-ng to assess Wi-Fi security.** 
```
airodump-ng wlan0
```
**2. Attempt to crack WPA/WPA2 passwords.**
```
aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -b <BSSID> capture_file.cap
```

# Lab 7: IoT Device Security Assessment

**1. Use tools like Shodan to discover IoT devices on the Internet.**
```
shodan search webcam
```
**2. Assess the security of identified IoT devices.**
